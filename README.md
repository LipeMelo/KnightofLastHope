# KnightofLastHope
My first actual game made in Unity

I made this project in a College class and took me about a month to complete, the goal was to make a simple game with learning purposes and this is how it turned out.

"Knight of Las Hope" is an Action 2D Arcade-like game where the player, who controls a knight with a magic sword, has the only goal to survive as long as he can while hordes of enemies come at him from all sides.

In this project I learned how to make a HUD and make animations for the player and enemies, how to make enemies spawn at certain locations at random with increasing intervals to increase the difficult, how to keep track and update the score and health o the player, how to make scenes for the different menus of the game, and a few other things but the most important of all how to make everything work together.

It was a fun experience, and I'm planning of coming back to it after a break.
